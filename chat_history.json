You want to create a mobile app for the University of Ghana to help students and visitors navigate the campus transportation system. The app should have four main tabs: Home, Search, Route, and Profile. Each tab should have clickable features that lead to other pages.\n\nHere's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Home Screen:** A welcoming dashboard displaying real-time shuttle information, campus announcements, and quick links to popular routes.\n-   **Search Screen:** A search bar to find specific shuttle routes, bus stops, or campus locations.\n-   **Route Screen:** Detailed information about selected routes, including schedules, bus stop locations, and estimated travel times.\n-   **Profile Screen:** User profile with options for settings, favorite routes, travel history, and help/support. Each of these options should be clickable and navigate to a dedicated screen.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f9f9` (Light Gray)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#00308F` (University of Ghana Blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#FF6F61` (Burnt Orange - Accent Color)\n    *   Accent: `#4CAF50` (Green - Success/Confirmation)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFEB3B` (Yellow - Important Information)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\", \"Roboto\", or \"Open Sans\" for readability.\n\nHere's the plan for the coding agent:\n\n1.  Modify the existing tab layout in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to include the four tabs: Home, Search, Route, and Profile. Use the `IconSymbol` component for tab icons.\n2.  Create the basic structure for each of the four tab screens: `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/search.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/route.tsx`, and `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`. Add placeholder text to each screen to indicate its purpose.\n3.  In `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`, create clickable elements (e.g., using `Pressable` components) for \"Settings,\" \"Favorite Routes,\" \"Travel History,\" and \"Help/Support.\" Each element should use `router.push` to navigate to a corresponding placeholder screen (e.g., `app/settings.tsx`, `app/favorite-routes.tsx`, `app/travel-history.tsx`, `app/help-support.tsx`). Create these placeholder screens as well.\n4.  Implement the color scheme in `app/_layout.tsx` by defining a custom theme using `DefaultTheme` from `@react-navigation/native` and applying it using `ThemeProvider`.\n5.  Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it is not relevant to the current requirements.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app for the University of Ghana!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-05T00:08:01.659202"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a University of Ghana campus transportation app with the four main pages and all the clickable navigation features.
